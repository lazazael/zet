Zettelkasten Repo. This is where I put my keep track of my notes, all my zettels about almost anything and everything. The idea is rather simple really and very powerful. It's the resource of my Anki flashcards.
**This readme.md is a zettel itself.**

* Title less than 50 UNICODE characters
* Body of about 25-30 lines
* References including URLs section after body
* Hashtags on last line after 4-space indent
* Use an Isosec identifier because human friendly
* Stick with single level lists
* Avoid subheadings (those are more for posts)
* *bold*, **ilalic**, ***bolditalic***
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main(){
fmt.println("Hello, World!")
}
```
