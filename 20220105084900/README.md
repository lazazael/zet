# wearing noise cancellation without pricey equipment 

The idea is that to cancel out environmental noise to avoid distractions. Some use noise cancelling earbuds like an Apple Airpods Pro, and wear over it noise cancelling construction gear earmuffs to reduce noise that the cancellation algorithm can't.
So I've come to the conclusion that it's possible to reverse the method cheaply with my current hardware which is a cabled headphones. I can reach the same level of noise cancellation by using general foam earplugs and taking my headphones over them. Outside noises are cancelled out completely. The sound comes muffled which doesn't seem to bother me currently since I use this setup for deep working rather than listening to music.
